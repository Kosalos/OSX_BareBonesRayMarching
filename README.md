# OSX_BareBonesRayMarching
Bare bones ray marching demo for the Mac using Swift 4.2 and Metal.

It takes surprisingly few lines of code to draw a ray marching fractal with Swift and Metal. \
Here's an example..

Was originally trying to make this the smallest/simplest app I could, but couldn't resist adding \
more and more fractal equations. \

This is still a simple app; everything about it stays the same for all the fractals. \
Just changes to the GUI to access the equation parameters, and the \
Distance Estimation routine for the RayMarching algorithm in the shader.

Includes equations for the following 3D fractals : \
MandelBulb \
Apollonian \
Apollonian2 \
Kleinian \
Mandelbox \
Quaternion Julia \
Monster \
Kali Tower \
Polyhedron Menger \
Gold \
Spider \
Kleinian2 \
KIFS \
Collection of many IFS fractals \
Knighty Polychora \
QuadRay \
3Dickulus FragM \
3Dickulus Quaternion Julia \
3Dickulus Quaternion Mandelbrot \
Kali's MandelBox \
Spudsville \
Menger Smooth Polyhedra
