Press 'O' to launch Equation Picker dialog

Note for arrow keys and jog keys :
Hold 'Shift' key for slow changes
Hold 'Option' key for fast changes
Hold both 'Shift' and 'Option' for very fast changes

Lt/Rt Arrows : Alter value of focused widget
Up/Dn Arrows : Move widget focus
Spacebar     : Toggle instructions Display

Note:  mouse click on widget to move focus directly

Keyboard commands ----------------------------

1,2 : Change Equation (previous, next)
3   : Toggle Cross-Eyed Stereo

===============================================
Jogging the camera, and Rotating the view direction

Use 4,5 for X
    6,7 for Y
    8,9 for Z
Add <shift> for slow jog
Add <option> for fast jog
Add <shift + option> for very fast jog

Add <control> to rotate the view direction rather than jog
(shift & option can be added during rotation to control speed)
===============================================
OrbitTraping
All of these algorithms are 'escape-time Fractals',
and by tracking certain variables as the escape is determined
we learn information that can be used to enhance the fractal coloring.

New widgets have been added:

Cycles:     how many times the trap controls are repeated
Strength:   relative brightness of trap coloring, from 0% to 100%
x Color:    assign Color to channel 'x' (252 colors)
x Weight:   specify how much channel 'x' adds to color, from -3 to +3

... the same 2 widgets for channels 'y' - 'r'

Fixed Trap has three values:
0: Orbit Trap calculated from ray point position
1: Orbit Trap calculated using distance of point from fixed point
2: fixed point is a relative distance from first ray point position

Note: Press key 'C' to cycle through 4 palettes of colors for trap effect
===============================================

0   : Toggle Full Screen

<,> : Adjust window size smaller/larger

?,/ : Toggle Fast Rendering
      (rendering is fast/blurry while keys are held down)
G   : Cycle through the coloring schemes
      note: certain color schemes have a widget entry called 'Color Boost'
      you'll need to fiddle with this parameter as well as
      Brightness for best results.
P   : Load Picture for texturing
      launches picture selection dialog.
      When active additional widgets alter which
      portions of the picture are rendered.
      Press 'P' again to stop texturing effect.
\   : Toggle window focus between 2D and 3D windows

home      : Launch Save/Load dialog.
end       : Load next saved image.
            Once you have multiple images saved: this cycles them.
page up   : Show this dialog
page down : Toggle display of companion 3D window

Video Recording ------------------------------

Press '[' to launch video recorder window.
Press ']' to hit <Add Keyframe to end> button on recorder window.

Mouse commands -------------------------------

When 3D window is active :
   Click/Drag with left mouse button to define the 3D Window
   Region of Interest

When 3D window is inActive :
   Click/Drag with left mouse button to pan image X,Y
   Click/Drag with right mouse button to pan image X,Z

Second Surface -------------------------------

When value is zero (set to lowest value), the image renders as normal.
When active (non-zero, specifying distance to move along ray),
the Distance Estimation equation does not return the first fractal
surface encountered, but instead continues to move along the ray
to search for the second surface.
Allows you to see 'inside' many fractal shapes.

Radial Symmetry ------------------------------

When value is zero (set to lowest value), the image renders as normal.
When active (non-zero, specifying pie wedge size in radians),
a pie slice shapged region of the image is repeated to form a mandala.

Coloring Effect ------------------------------

Press 'M' to toggle coloring Effect
When active, the 'Scale' widget manages its' effect

----------------------------------------------
