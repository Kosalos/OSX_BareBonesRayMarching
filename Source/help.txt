Video Recording ------------------------------

You define a video recording by saving a list of keyframes.
Each keyframe captures all your widget settings.
When the list is complete,
you direct the app to build the video.
The app will interpolate 100 video frames for each keyframe,
as it smoothly alters all widget settings.

Press '[' to store keyframes.
You must store at least two keyframes to define a video session.
When ready, press ']' to complete the keyframes definition.
The app will then calculate all the video frames,
and save them toa '.m4v' video file
(deep in the bowels of the app's documents folder).

Note: Don't alter the window size during a recording session.
