Video recorder Window

You define a video recording by saving a list of keyframes.
Each keyframe captures all your widget settings,
except brightness, contrast, specular and color scheme.

Note: the <Add Keyframe to end> button can be pressed as ']'
on the main window.

Video frames per keyframe:
Affects the duration and smoothness of the video.

Smoothing Factor:
Sets the stength of the rolling average algorithm that smoothes
the effect of parameter changes between keyframes.
Set to '0' to skip this effect.

Ease In/Out:
Is the interpolation algorithm plain linear, or does it slowdown or
speed up at the ends of each keyframe region.

The videos are .m4v files.
Do a Finder search to them in the documents folder of this app.

Note:
While a video is being created you can press <Space> to stop immediately.

Don't change the equation # during a recording.
Don't change the window size during a recording.
